/**
 * There are several interesting points to execute arbitrary code during a
 * task in Onyx. Onyx lets you plug in and calls functions before a task,
 * after a task, before a batch, and after a batch on every peer.
 * Additionally, there is another lifecycle hook that allows you to delay
 * starting a task in case you need to do some work like acquiring a
 * lock under contention. A peerâ€™s lifecycle is isolated to itself,
 * and lifecycles never coordinate across peers. Usage of lifecycles
 * are entirely optional. Lifecycle data is submitted as a data structure
 * at job submission time.
 * Lifecycle derives from OnyxEntity.
