# onyx-java

Onyx-Java provides a simple Java interface for the Onyx Platform's core API, utilities for manipulating Clojure maps directly in Java, tools to simplify use of core.async plugins, and affordances for inclusion of pure Java classes in a workflow.   <br>
<br>

## Overview
Onyx-Java follows the Onyx Platform's core API providing Java peer's for each aspect of a workflow. I.e. Catalogs, Lifecycles, Jobs, etc. <br>
<br>
These classes provide methods to add entries to your workflow description ensuring that they are converted into Clojure-native types when needed. Note that this approach doesn't validate semantic correctness of your entries, which are enforced at runtime.<br>
<br>
### Utilities

#### Onyx Environment 

Bootstrapping and management of the Onyx Platform's involves several pieces which require carefully ordered calls during spin up and shutdown. Additionally, all core API calls require that this metadata be readily available. The management class *OnyxEnv* is provided to simplify management of the environment and proxying methods to encapsulate this complexity.

#### Maps

A utility class, MapFns, offers Java-esk versions of (some) Clojure map munipulation functions, like get-in, making it easier to directly manipulate Clojure map's. It also provides support for loading edn files of simple maps from resources making it easier to manage entries like environment and peer configuration. <br>
<br>

#### Core Async

Support for the use of core.async plugins are provided via a pair of Java classes. AsyncCatalog and AsyncLifecycles encapsulate generating the correct catalog and lifecycle entries, as well as providing support methods for use during job runtime to pass and collect data.<br>
<br>

#### Java Objects

Support for use of pure Java objects in a workflow is provided via an abstract base class, OnyxFn, along with a catalog generation tool CatalogUtils. <br>
<br>
*OnyxFn* is an abstract base class with a constructor that takes a Clojure map, and an abstract method that consumes the Clojure map segment. *CatalogUtils* provides a means to create an instance-aware catalog entry that calls your bootrapped derived instance at runtime.<br>
<br>

## Usage

This section is non-exhaustive but lays out the general approach giving a feel for use of the API in practice. Full examples are provided in test.<br>
<br>

### Basic

Basic usage of this package is demonstrated in three classes related to pure Java testing. The base class, SingleFnTest.java,
contains clear, simple methods demonstrating the high level
view on what is required for a successful job run. It contains nested setup functions that show in an obvious way what steps and in which order things must be built. It also contains functions related to setting up an environment and running a job as well as stopping a job and tearing down the environment. The public 'run' method is the entry point to a test.

<br>

The extending classes, SingleJavaTest and SingleCljTest,
demonstrate how catalogs must be built separately depending
on the language that a given function task is written in.
<br>

This separation demonstrates how OnyxJava easily provides the ability to use Java objects and methods as tasks without removing the ability to use tasks written in pure clojure (and potentially other languages).

<br>

It is important to note that only a very small variation in setup behavior exists between task functions written in different languages, and that all of the logic contained in the base SingleFnTest class will remain the same.

<br>



### Java Objects

Inclusion of Java task objects in a workflow requires that you provide a concrete subclass of OnyxFn:<br>
<br>

```
package onyxplatform.test;

import clojure.lang.IPersistentMap;

import org.onyxplatform.api.java.instance.OnyxFn;

public class PassFn extends OnyxFn {

        public PassFn(IPersistentMap m) {
                super(m);
        }

        public Object consumeSegment(IPersistentMap m) {
                return m;
        }
}
```

<br>
Then, using the fully qualified name of your class and any constructor parameters, you use CatalogUtils to generate a matching catalog entry:<br>
<br>

```
	Catalog catalog = new Catalog();

	String taskName = "pass";
	String fullyQualifiedName = "onyxplatform.test.PassFn";
	IPersitentMap ctrArgs = MapFns.emptyMap();

	int batchSize = 5;
	int batchTimeout = 50;

	CatalogUtils.addFn(catalog, batchSize, batchTimeout, fullyQualifiedName, ctrArgs);
```

<br>
This will add the appropriate entry to bind task processing to a specific instance of your class that is loaded and called at job runtime.<br>
<br>

#### NOTE: There are parallel clojure namespaces and functions that provide affordances for clojure-based workflows.
